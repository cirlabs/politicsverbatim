Politics Verbatim

Politics Verbatim was a project of the Center for Investigative Reporting and California Watch
to track the attacks, claims, promises and other statements by California's two major-party
candidates in the 2010 gubernatorial election. You can see it in action at www.politicsverbatim.org.

Though it was built very quickly (and not especially cleanly), the PV platform can easily be adapted
to other situations, including elections, legislative debates, tracking pundits, and basically any
situation in which the goal is to track and chronicle what people are saying.

For now, we're making the platform available (minus much cleanup) for anyone who wants it. We'll clean it up
if there's demand for it. Otherwise, feel free to pick through it. You might find something useful!
